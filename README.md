# Room Booking Web Application Project
## Internet Based System Architectures
## Institure Tecnico Superior

### WORK IN PROGRESS...

### Introduction:
Students at IST have difficulties regarding the space required to study while on campus. Such that, a way to manage this situation would be the creation of a system in which students can book their own space in a specific room. Such a system would be managed daily by admins which make rooms on campus available to students. 

### Components:
- Browser: HTML + JS + AJAX
- Web-server: python + bottlepy
- Data storage: Google Cloud Storage (noSQL)
- FENIX platform: JSON (web-server interacts with FENIX platform to get data)

### Running:
- Need Google Cloud SDK
- In the folder /rooms-webapp-project/src/ist-rooms/ run:
$dev_appserver.py ./
